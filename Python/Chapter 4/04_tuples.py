# creating a tuple using ()
t = (2, 3, 45, 6)
# print(t)
# t1 = () # Empty tuple
# print(t1)
t2 = (1) # Wrong way to declar a tuple with single element
t2 = (1,) # Tuple with single element
print(t2)
# Printing the value of tuple
# print(t[1])

# cannot update any tuple value
# t[0] = 43 Will always show error
